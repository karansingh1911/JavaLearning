There are 3 types or errors in Java:
1. Compile-time Error= also called syntactical error => System.out.Println("");
2. Logical Error => no error yet expected output/result is different => bugs
3. Runtime Error => execution Stops due to some external issus...  => Very Imp. to handle especially for production


Statements:
1. Normal
2. Critical

Workflow
=> If any issue occurs in try block the catch returns an exception object
=> The Exception e (meaning e is a object of class Exception) here Exception class is a parent class of all the famous exception child classes like:

🧮 Arithmetic & Number-related exceptions:

Exception	When it happens
1.ArithmeticException	Divide by zero (int x = 10/0;)
2.NumberFormatException	Converting invalid string to number (Integer.parseInt("abc"))
3.InputMismatchException	Wrong type entered in Scanner input (expecting int but entered text)


📦 Array and Collection-related

Exception	When it happens
1.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException	Accessing invalid array index
2.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException	Accessing invalid character index in a String
3.IndexOutOfBoundsException	General parent class for index-related errors
4.NullPointerException	Trying to use a null reference
5.ConcurrentModificationException	Modifying a collection while iterating over it


💾 Input / Output exceptions

Exception	When it happens
1.IOException	General I/O error (reading/writing files, streams)
2.FileNotFoundException	File doesn’t exist while trying to open it
3.EOFException	Unexpected end of file reached
4.MalformedURLException	Invalid URL syntax
5.SocketException	Network socket-related issues


🧠 Class & Reflection-related

Exception	When it happens
1.ClassNotFoundException	Class not found while loading dynamically
2.NoClassDefFoundError	JVM couldn’t load a class definition at runtime
3.InstantiationException	Trying to instantiate an abstract class or interface via reflection
4.IllegalAccessException	Accessing a class member you don’t have rights to
5.InvocationTargetException	Exception thrown by a method invoked via reflection

⚙️ Threading & Concurrency

Exception	When it happens
1.InterruptedException	Thread interrupted while sleeping or waiting
2.IllegalThreadStateException	Illegal thread operation (like starting a thread twice)
3.ExecutionException	Exception thrown during concurrent task execution

💬 Runtime / General

Exception	When it happens
1.IllegalArgumentException	Method received invalid argument
2.IllegalStateException	Method called at inappropriate time
3.UnsupportedOperationException	Operation not supported by object
4.SecurityException	Security manager denies access
5.RuntimeException	Base class for all unchecked exceptions


🧱 Checked Exceptions (must handle)

Exception	Typical use case
1.SQLException	Database access errors
2.IOException	Input/Output stream issues
3.ParseException	Error while parsing formatted data
4.ClassNotFoundException	When loading classes dynamically


💡 Quick rule of thumb:

1.Unchecked exceptions (like ArithmeticException, NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException) → extend RuntimeException.

2.Checked exceptions (like IOException, SQLException) → extend Exception but not RuntimeException.
You must handle or declare checked ones.
